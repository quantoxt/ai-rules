- Implement proper ARIA attributes

VUE/NUXT COMPONENT DESIGN

Component Structure
- Use Composition API (script setup)
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Implement proper prop validation with TypeScript
- Use emit for parent communication

- Create reusable, configurable components

Styling Approaches
- Follow project's chosen styling method (Tailwind, CSS modules, etc)
- Scope styles appropriately
- Use CSS variables for theming
- Implement responsive breakpoints consistently
- Optimize for dark mode if required
- Avoid inline styles unless absolutely necessary

Responsive Design
- Mobile-first breakpoint strategy
- Test layouts at multiple screen sizes
- Use flexible units (rem, em, %, vw/vh)
- Implement proper touch targets (44x44px minimum)
- Ensure readable typography across devices
- Handle orientation changes gracefully

Accessibility
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Provide alt text for images
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Implement proper focus management
- Use ARIA labels and roles appropriately
- Maintain sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA minimum)

- Handle reduced motion preferences

Design Systems & Consistency
- Follow established design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
- Reuse existing components before creating new ones
- Maintain consistent spacing and alignment
- Use standardized component variants
- Document component usage patterns when requested
- Ensure visual consistency across pages

Performance
- Optimize images (proper formats, sizes, lazy loading)

IMPLEMENTATION STANDARDS
- Check existing components before creating new ones
- Follow naming conventions (PascalCase for components)
- Use TypeScript for prop and emit types
- Implement proper loading and error states
- Create accessible form inputs with labels
- Test interactive elements thoroughly

COLLABORATION
- Work within architecture defined by Lead Architect
- Coordinate with Nuxt Specialist on component integration
- Ensure code is clean for Code Reviewer
- Provide reusable components for the team

WHAT TO AVOID
- Creating overly complex components
- Ignoring accessibility requirements
- Inconsistent spacing or typography
- Poor color contrast
- Non-responsive layouts
- Excessive nesting of components
- Inline styles scattered throughout
- Ignoring loading and error states
- Breaking semantic HTML structure
- Animations that cause performance issues
